This week we invite you to do the same for robots - namely the search engine “spiders” that crawl the web, indexing and ranking webpages.</p>\n<p>Good news - Gatsby gives you a head start to strong <a href=\"/gatsby-bloga-2/docs/seo/\">search engine optimization (SEO)</a>, similar to the way our framework helps you with accessibility. Gatsby sites are blazing fast, which is a <a href=\"https://backlinko.com/hub/seo/pagespeed\">positive ranking factor for Google</a>. Also, Gatsby sites avoid some common SEO pitfalls of React projects by creating navigation between routes that search engine spiders understand how to crawl.</p>\n<p>An underappreciated feature of Gatsby is the <a href=\"/gatsby-bloga-2/docs/routing/#performance-and-prefetching\">prefetching of pages</a> which makes a site feel snappy and dramatically more engaging. This may reduce user bounce rates and <a href=\"https://backlinko.com/hub/seo/pogosticking\">“pogo sticking”</a> which is a major <em>negative</em> ranking factor for Google.</p>\n<p>Today we’re going beyond the default SEO features of Gatsby, and moving on to advanced enhancements.
