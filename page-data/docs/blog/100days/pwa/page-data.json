And it’s true - a Gatsby project <a href=\"/gatsby-bloga-2/docs/overview-of-the-gatsby-build-process/\">is built into a set of static assets</a> that can be hosted on a <a href=\"/gatsby-bloga-2/docs/winning-over-engineering-leaders/#lower-costs\">low cost CDN</a>, for <em>by-default</em> security and blazing fast speed.</p>\n<p>But Gatsby is best understood as a Progressive Web App generator, because with Gatsby you can produce websites with native mobile app capabilities. A Progressive Web App (PWA) is a new class of website that takes advantage of the web browser’s access to mobile device APIs, to provide features traditionally only associated with native apps.</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-resp-iframe-wrapper\" style=\"padding-bottom: 56.25%; position: relative; height: 0; overflow: hidden; margin-bottom: 1.0725rem\" > <iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/z2JgN6Ae-Bo\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen title=\"Progressive Web Apps - PWA Roadshow\" style=\" position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; \"></iframe> </div>\n<p>Imagine giving your website enhancements like offline mode, home screen installation, and push notifications. Well, those are exactly the features we want you to add to your Gatsby project this week!</p>\n<h3>Challenge Resources</h3>\n<p>First, read our doc about <a href=\"/gatsby-bloga-2/docs/progressive-web-app/\">what makes a PWA</a>, a true PWA.</p>\n<p>Next, add <a href=\"/gatsby-bloga-2/packages/gatsby-plugin-manifest\">gatsby-plugin-manifest</a> to your site. THis makes it possible for users to save your site to their home screen.</p>\n<p>Now, add <a href=\"/gatsby-bloga-2/packages/gatsby-plugin-offline\">gatsby-plugin-offline</a> to your project. As the name suggests, this plugin will give your site’s users the ability to still navigate to different pages, even in airplane mode, or with a poor internet connection.</p>\n<h3>What to Do If You Need Help</h3>\n<p>If you get stuck during the challenge, you can ask for help from the <a href=\"/gatsby-bloga-2/contributing/community/\">Gatsby community</a> and the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AskGatsbyJS\">ASKGatsbyJS</a> Twitter account.
