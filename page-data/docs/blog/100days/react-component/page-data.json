If you are new to Gatsby, you can follow along with our beginner-friendly weekly prompts. Or if you are familiar with Gatsby and want to go deeper, we invite you to <a href=\"/gatsby-bloga-2/docs/themes/building-themes/\">build your first Gatsby Theme</a>.</em></p>\n<p><em>Learn more about <a href=\"/gatsby-bloga-2/blog/100days\">#100DaysOfGatsby here</a>!</em></p>\n<h2>Challenge 4: Add a Form to Your Site (Using a Third-Party React Library)</h2>\n<p>The Gatsby framework is <a href=\"/gatsby-bloga-2/docs/glossary/react/\">based on React</a>. So, a Gatsby project is a React project. And the Gatsby ecosystem is a subset of the React ecosystem.</p>\n<p>This is exciting! There are hundreds of <a href=\"/gatsby-bloga-2/plugins/\">Gatsby plugins and themes</a> you can use on your site, with more being added every day. But there are already thousands of free, well-tested React projects that you can use on your site too!</p>\n<p>For example, you can hide/show your site header with <a href=\"https://kyleamathews.github.io/react-headroom/\">React headroom</a>, organize your CSS with <a href=\"https://theme-ui.com/\">Theme UI</a>, or control your HTML head with <a href=\"https://github.com/nfl/react-helmet\">React Helmet</a>.</p>\n<p>In this prompt, we invite you to add forms to your Gatsby site using <a href=\"https://jaredpalmer.com/formik\">Formik, a popular and powerful React library</a>. We suggest adding the form to the “About” page you created in a previous challenge.</p>\n<p>(In a future challenge we will show you how to add your form, or any React component to your Markdown-powered blog pages.)</p>\n<h3>Challenge Resources</h3>\n<p>Learn how to <a href=\"/gatsby-bloga-2/docs/adding-react-components/\">import and use almost any React component</a> in your Gatsby project. However, instead of using the example in our documentation, install <a href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/package/formik\">Formik from npm</a>.</p>\n<p>Next, follow <a href=\"https://jaredpalmer.com/formik/docs/tutorial\">Formik’s step-by-step tutorial</a> for creating a newsletter signup form.</p>\n<p>Lastly, familiarize yourself with the <a href=\"/gatsby-bloga-2/docs/building-a-contact-form/#creating-an-accessible-form\">accessibility guidelines regarding forms</a>, and ensure your form meets those standards.</p>\n<h3>What to Do If You Need Help</h3>\n<p>If you get stuck during the challenge, you can ask for help from the <a href=\"/gatsby-bloga-2/contributing/community/\">Gatsby community</a> and the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AskGatsbyJS\">ASKGatsbyJS</a> Twitter account. You can find fellow Gatsby Developers on <a href=\"https://discordapp.com/invite/gatsby\">Discord</a>, <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/gatsbyjs/\">Reddit</a>, <a href=\"https://spectrum.chat/gatsby-js\">Spectrum</a>, and <a href=\"https://dev.to/t/gatsby\">Dev</a>.</p>\n<p>For this challenge, you can also ask the <a href=\"https://jaredpalmer.com/formik/help\">Formik community</a> for help.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Challenge 4 - Add Third-Party React Components to Your Gatsby Site","date":"January 23, 2020","description":null}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/docs/blog/100days/react-component/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/docs/blog/2020-01-15-website-uptime/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Why Teams Using Gatsby Sleep Better At Night"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/docs/blog/2020-01-23-why-typescript-chose-gatsby/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Why the TypeScript team is using Gatsby for its new website"}}}}}
