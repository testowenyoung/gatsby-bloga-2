If you are new to Gatsby, you can follow along with our beginner-friendly weekly prompts. Or if you are familiar with Gatsby and want to go deeper, we invite you to <a href=\"/gatsby-bloga-2/docs/themes/building-themes/\">build your first Gatsby Theme</a>.</em></p>\n<p><em>Learn more about <a href=\"/gatsby-bloga-2/blog/100days\">#100DaysOfGatsby here</a>!</em></p>\n<h2>Challenge 2: Build and Deploy Your Gatsby Site (Using Free Tools)</h2>\n<p>This week we invite you to deploy your Gatsby project to the web!</p>\n<p>If you’re experienced with launching an all-in-one CMS-powered or database-backed website, then the process of putting a Gatsby site live on the web may feel strange to you. You will be using continuous deployment tools to prepare and publish your site. It’s okay if your site is unfinished, as getting a website deployed will allow you to test on mobile devices and share with your colleagues to get feedback on design and development.</p>\n<p>To complete this challenge, we would like you to:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>host your project in a cloud git repository (publicly or privately),</li>\n<li>then use a “build service” to create a production version of your site</li>\n<li>and automatically publish your site’s assets directly to a Content Delivery Network (CDN).</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Amazingly, for small projects you can use all of these services for free. There are many Gatsby sites in the wild that pay $0 for hosting!</p>\n<p>Bonus: Try deploying your site to the free tier of multiple services to see first hand which one you’d like to adopt. You may notice differences in features, developer experience, and build speeds and limits.</p>\n<h3>Challenge Resources</h3>\n<p>For your git repo, you can use GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, or many similar services.</p>\n<p>And for your build tool and CDN we see many people have success with <a href=\"/gatsby-bloga-2/docs/deploying-to-aws-amplify/\">AWS Amplify</a>, <a href=\"/gatsby-bloga-2/docs/deploying-to-netlify/\">Netlify</a>, and <a href=\"/gatsby-bloga-2/docs/deploying-to-vercel\">Vercel</a>. Our documentation has step-by-step tutorials for those services, <a href=\"/gatsby-bloga-2/docs/deploying-and-hosting/\">and others</a>.</p>\n<h3>What to Do If You Need Help</h3>\n<p>If you get stuck during the challenge, you can ask for help from the <a href=\"/gatsby-bloga-2/contributing/community/\">Gatsby community</a> and the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AskGatsbyJS\">ASKGatsbyJS</a> Twitter account.. You can find fellow Gatsby Developers on <a href=\"https://discordapp.com/invite/gatsby\">Discord</a>, <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/gatsbyjs/\">Reddit</a>, <a href=\"https://spectrum.chat/gatsby-js\">Spectrum</a>, and <a href=\"https://dev.to/t/gatsby\">Dev</a>.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Challenge 2 - Host Your Gatsby Site for Free","date":"January 08, 2020","description":null}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/docs/blog/100days/free-hosting/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/docs/blog/100days/start-blog/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Challenge 1 - Track Your Coding Progress with a Blazing Fast Blog"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/docs/blog/100days/gatsby-image/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Challenge 3 - Auto-Optimize Images on Your Gatsby Site"}}}}}
