A writer on your team can use Markdown’s friendly syntax and contribute content to a site without having to edit HTML or JSX directly.</p>\n<p>Today we invite you to use MDX, a new format that lets you add components in your Markdown documents. Now, editors can add interactive and styled elements to their documents, not just static, plain text.</p>\n<h3>Challenge Resources</h3>\n<p>Use <a href=\"/gatsby-bloga-2/docs/mdx/\">Gatsby’s MDX tutorial</a> and substitute the example “chart component” with the <a href=\"/gatsby-bloga-2/blog/100days/react-component/\">“form component” you created</a> in a previous challenge.</p>\n<p>Bonus: Learn about an advanced <a href=\"https://mdxjs.com/blog/shortcodes\">MDX feature, “shortcodes”</a>. Then enable an example of this feature by using a Gatsby plugin from the community, <a href=\"/gatsby-bloga-2/packages/@pauliescanlon/gatsby-mdx-embed/\">gatsby-mdx-embed</a>.</p>\n<h3>What to Do If You Need Help</h3>\n<p>If you get stuck during the challenge, you can ask for help from the <a href=\"/gatsby-bloga-2/contributing/community/\">Gatsby community</a> and the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AskGatsbyJS\">ASKGatsbyJS</a> Twitter account.
