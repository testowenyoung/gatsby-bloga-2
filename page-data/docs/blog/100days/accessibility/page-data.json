However as you continue to develop your project, and your editors begin adding content to the site, all three of those site features may suffer.</p>\n<p>Over the next three challenges, we’ll ask you to enhance your site’s performance, <a href=\"/gatsby-bloga-2/blog/100days/seo\">SEO</a>, and accessibility, starting with the accessibility of your forms and images.</p>\n<p>As a Gatsby developer, you want to ensure that everyone can access your work, including users who rely on assistive technology to read and navigate your site. Two of the biggest sinkholes for these users are inaccessible forms and images. In previous prompts, we asked you to add images and forms to your project. Now that you have those elements on your site, we ask that you examine and ensure their accessibility.</p>\n<h3>Accessibility Challenge Resources</h3>\n<h4>Images</h4>\n<p>Become familiar with <a href=\"/gatsby-bloga-2/docs/making-your-site-accessible/#linting-with-eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y\">eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y</a>. Gatsby ships with the<code class=\"language-text\">eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y</code> package and warnings for all of its rules enabled by default. <code class=\"language-text\">eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y</code> is an accessibility linting tool for your code, and encourages you to include alternative text for image tags.</p>\n<h4>Forms</h4>\n<p>Read why we believe <a href=\"/gatsby-bloga-2/docs/building-a-contact-form/#creating-an-accessible-form\">accessible forms are important</a>. Then apply <a href=\"https://webaim.org/techniques/forms/\">WebAIM’s advice</a> to your own forms.</p>\n<h4>What to Do If You Need Help</h4>\n<p>If you get stuck during the challenge, you can ask for help from the <a href=\"/gatsby-bloga-2/contributing/community/\">Gatsby community</a> and the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AskGatsbyJS\">AskGatsbyJS</a> Twitter account.
