Up until now you‚Äôve created a website with Markdown files, and you‚Äôve had Gatsby <a href=\"/gatsby-bloga-2/tutorial/part-seven/\">programmatically create pages</a> using those files, which is pretty cool. But Gatsby can do so much more‚Ä¶</p>\n<p>What makes Gatsby unique and immensely useful for your most demanding client projects is the framework‚Äôs ability to source content from anywhere, and make it available through a flexible data layer.</p>\n<p>As Kyle Mathews <a href=\"/gatsby-bloga-2/blog/2019-01-31-why-themes/\">wrote</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>‚ÄúA little-understood reason for Gatsby‚Äôs popularity: Gatsby‚Äôs data layer has the highly novel feature of enabling people to build and share data processing primitives that automatically work together and are exposed and controlled through a consistent GraphQL API. In most other frameworks, you‚Äôd need to build much of this yourself in a one-off, brittle fashion. Gatsby‚Äôs data layer enables simple snapping together of data sourcing and transformation primitives enabling the content mesh.‚Äù</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The website you‚Äôre on right now is a combination of content from Airtable, Markdown, and raw JSX. Gatsbyjs.org also has a swag store that sources content from Shopify, and the <a href=\"https://gatsbyjs.com\">Gatsby Cloud website</a> gets data from Contentful and a PostgreSQL database. The days of shoehorning multiple content types into a monolithic CMS <a href=\"/gatsby-bloga-2/blog/2018-10-04-journey-to-the-content-mesh\">are over</a>. Now you can choose the best tool for the job, and stack (or switch) CMS‚Äôs easily.</p>\n<p>Today we challenge you to add an external data source (or two) to your Gatsby project!</p>\n<h3>Challenge Resources</h3>\n<ol>\n<li><a href=\"/gatsby-bloga-2/docs/headless-cms/\">‚ÄúWhat is a headless CMS?‚Äù</a> is a solid place to get started. It also lists specific CMS‚Äôs that have Gatsby ‚Äúsource‚Äù plugins you can install..</li>\n<li>If you‚Äôre not sure which CMS to choose, many Gatsby users have had success with <a href=\"/gatsby-bloga-2/docs/sourcing-from-contentful/\">Contentful</a>, <a href=\"/gatsby-bloga-2/blog/2018-06-07-build-a-gatsby-blog-using-the-cosmic-js-source-plugin/\">Cosmic</a>, and <a href=\"/gatsby-bloga-2/docs/recipes/sourcing-data/\">DatoCMS</a>. If you want to use an <a href=\"/gatsby-bloga-2/blog/2019-10-15-free-headless-cms/\">open source and free CMS</a>, try WordPress, Ghost, Netlify CMS, and Drupal.</li>\n<li>If you‚Äôd like to learn from fully baked examples, <a href=\"https://www.gatsbyjs.com/get-started\">auto-provision a site from Gatsby Cloud</a>. Examine and experiment with the gatsby-node.js API file and any additional plugins the CMS developers decided to add. Use the patterns you discover in your own project.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>What to Do If You Need Help</h3>\n<p>If you get stuck during the challenge, you can ask for help from the <a href=\"/gatsby-bloga-2/contributing/community/\">Gatsby community</a> and the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AskGatsbyJS\">ASKGatsbyJS</a> Twitter account.
