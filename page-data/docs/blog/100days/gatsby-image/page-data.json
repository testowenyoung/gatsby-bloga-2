If you are new to Gatsby, you can follow along with our beginner-friendly weekly prompts. Or if you are familiar with Gatsby and want to go deeper, we invite you to <a href=\"/gatsby-bloga-2/docs/themes/building-themes/\">build your first Gatsby Theme</a>.</em></p>\n<p><em>Over 3,000 web developers have registered for the challenge! Learn more about <a href=\"/gatsby-bloga-2/blog/100days\">#100DaysOfGatsby here</a>!</em></p>\n<h2>Challenge 3: Learn How to Use Images with Gatsby</h2>\n<p>Gatsby sites are known for their <a href=\"/gatsby-bloga-2/blog/2019-01-30-flamingo-case-study\">blazing fast speed</a>. The way a Gatsby site <a href=\"/gatsby-bloga-2/docs/using-gatsby-image/\">optimizes images</a> is a big reason for that.</p>\n<p>This week’s challenge invites you to add images to your blog and learn about a popular and powerful Gatsby feature, <code class=\"language-text\">gatsby-image</code>.</p>\n<h3>Part 1</h3>\n<p>Add images to your markdown-based blog posts. If you are doing each challenge sequentially, then you have a <a href=\"/gatsby-bloga-2/blog/100days/start-blog/\">Gatsby blog that uses markdown</a> for blog posts, and is <a href=\"/gatsby-bloga-2/blog/100days/free-hosting/\">deployed live to a CDN</a>.</p>\n<p>But what good is a blog without beautiful images? We want you to use the resources section below to add auto-optimized images to your markdown blog posts!</p>\n<h3>Part 2</h3>\n<p>Now it’s time to get direct experience using the <code class=\"language-text\">Img</code>React component provided by <a href=\"/gatsby-bloga-2/packages/gatsby-image/\"><code class=\"language-text\">gatsby-image</code></a>! Create an about page using JSX, then use the gatsby-image API to transform a normal selfie into a square, black-and-white image.</p>\n<p>Bonus: Take note of the build times for your site before and after you add images to your project. Also, record the performance of specific pages with images, using <a href=\"/gatsby-bloga-2/docs/audit-with-lighthouse/\">a tool like Lighthouse</a>. As a Gatsby Developer you should be aware of how images affect your site’s production and user experience.</p>\n<h2>Challenge Resources</h2>\n<h3>Part 1 Resource</h3>\n<p>Follow this tutorial that explains how to <a href=\"/gatsby-bloga-2/docs/working-with-images-in-markdown/\">add images to your markdown-based pages</a>. After you configure your site as outlined, Gatsby will auto-optimize your images for you.</p>\n<h3>Part 2 Resource</h3>\n<p><a href=\"/gatsby-bloga-2/docs/recipes/pages-layouts/#creating-pages-automatically\">Create an About page</a> using JSX, the preferred templating language for <a href=\"/gatsby-bloga-2/docs/glossary/react/\">React</a>. After that, you can <a href=\"/gatsby-bloga-2/docs/working-with-images\">learn about gatsby-image</a>, then <a href=\"/gatsby-bloga-2/docs/gatsby-image/\">use its API</a> to transform your selfie into a black-and-white square.</p>\n<h2>How to Get Help</h2>\n<p>Depending on your experience with Gatsby and React, this may be the hardest challenge we’ve given you.
