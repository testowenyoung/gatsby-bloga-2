Here’s some of our conversation:</p>\n<h2>The Gatsby answer: Better code, SEO, page load times, and integration</h2>\n<p>Ritual chose a rebuild with Gatsby due to the restrictions they were running into with liquid templates and UI-based content changes. While static and fast, the issues were making it more difficult to bring code up to their modern engineering standards. They also needed to enable other teams to quickly and easily change copy, imagery and new concepts. Both of these led them to look for a new solution - Gatsby.</p>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 590px; \"\n    >\n      <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/gatsby-bloga-2/static/23b9c4063d0679f7d6e210ca995cb5bf/3e992/ritual_product.png\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n    <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 49.32432432432432%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"ritual product\"\n        title=\"ritual product\"\n        src=\"/gatsby-bloga-2/static/23b9c4063d0679f7d6e210ca995cb5bf/fcda8/ritual_product.png\"\n        srcset=\"/gatsby-bloga-2/static/23b9c4063d0679f7d6e210ca995cb5bf/12f09/ritual_product.png 148w,\n/gatsby-bloga-2/static/23b9c4063d0679f7d6e210ca995cb5bf/e4a3f/ritual_product.png 295w,\n/gatsby-bloga-2/static/23b9c4063d0679f7d6e210ca995cb5bf/fcda8/ritual_product.png 590w,\n/gatsby-bloga-2/static/23b9c4063d0679f7d6e210ca995cb5bf/efc66/ritual_product.png 885w,\n/gatsby-bloga-2/static/23b9c4063d0679f7d6e210ca995cb5bf/c83ae/ritual_product.png 1180w,\n/gatsby-bloga-2/static/23b9c4063d0679f7d6e210ca995cb5bf/3e992/ritual_product.png 1902w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 590px) 100vw, 590px\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n      />\n  </a>\n    </span></p>\n<p>“We were looking for opportunities to combine a powerful CMS with React and Styled Components for maximum composability, while still maintaining a static-site for optimized SEO and page load times,” shared Daniel.</p>\n<p>In addition, they had some specific business and impact goals they were trying to achieve with the new site and top on that list was improving their development velocity.</p>\n<Pullquote citation=\"Daniel Archer\">\n  We felt that investing in the combination of React, GraphQL, and a headless\n  CMS as early as possible would allow us to streamline our delivery pipeline\n  and iterate faster.\n</Pullquote>\n<h2>Gatsby and React: Shorter builds, rapid changes</h2>\n<p>Although they considered alternatives like Django, Ghost and Jekyll, they realized these other solutions would require significant new tooling, a longer timeline and a longer ramp-up period.</p>\n<Pullquote citation=\"Daniel Archer\">\n  We first chose Gatsby because of the appeal with one popular Gatsby solution\n  of using Contentful and Netlify. We felt like it was a compelling ideal to\n  empower our content and creative teams to make rapid changes to our site, and\n  to enable our engineering team to develop in simple, reusable React components\n  that work with a GraphQL interface.\n</Pullquote>\n<h2>Results: Scaling through Gatsby v1 and Gatsby v2</h2>\n<p>The initial site re-launched on Gatsby v1 while bringing over some of the legacy pages into the overall codebase. Since then, the six-member Ritual team has rebuilt legacy pages using their new engineering practices, iterated over several other site pages and subsequently upgraded to Gatsby v2, which was a “fairly seamless” and painless process.</p>\n<Pullquote citation=\"Daniel Archer\">\n  I think the most important facet of the Gatsby experience is its Node\n  environment, enabling data to not only inform the content of our site, but how\n  it’s structured and the pages within. It’s allowed us to scale out many pages\n  very quickly, and to easily relate among data nodes.\n</Pullquote>\n<p>And like so many others, Daniel confirmed that the Gatsby “documentation and community are <em>huge</em> reasons for anybody to pay attention to Gatsby. There’s so many great plugins and open source contributions as well, making it such a vibrant community of talented engineers.”</p>\n<p>Is this your kind of community?
