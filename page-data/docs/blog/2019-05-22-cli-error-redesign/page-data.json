So it has a huge influence on people’s experience of Gatsby.</p>\n<p>We conducted 4 usability tests with awesome Gatsby users to learn how they do tasks using the Gatsby CLI and how they use error messages to debug their projects.

They don’t comply with best practices suggested by the research we did.</p>\n<p>We did a thorough search of other CLIs and style guides to learn what we’re doing well and where we might be falling short.
