A big thank you to all the developers who came to these workshops, and another big thank you to Ryan Florence for organizing the workshop logistics; check out his company’s website at <a href=\"https://workshop.me/\">workshop.me</a>. Ryan has been an awesome supporter of Gatsby and a longtime fan, so yes, the workshop.me site is built on Gatsby :).</p>\n<p>We will keep improving these workshops and hope you’ll help us do that!

if these appeal to you, you could consider hosting your own workshop at your work, a meetup, or any other setting that makes sense!</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Dedicated time and place to learn:</em> it’s easier to set aside time to learn something new when you are in a room with other people doing the same thing</li>\n<li><em>Quicker problem-solving:</em> you can usually get answers to your questions and solve problems faster than you could otherwise</li>\n<li><em>Customized content:</em> the workshop host can customize the workshop for the group’s needs ahead of time by sending out a survey, and the workshop can shift focus depending on real-time needs and questions of the group and individuals</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We’d love to hear how it goes and hope that you’ll use the resources below.</p>\n<h2>Where to find workshop resources</h2>\n<p>Please use the following links to find workshop materials in the Gatsby open source repo:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Survey questions to send out <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/a/gatsbyjs.com/forms/d/1S6diwCjR36VSJod7DGL0ZpESx3KdaNGiB4Szl4hOpg0/edit?usp=sharing\">before</a> and <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/a/gatsbyjs.com/forms/d/1iKok_QJHSav51_668QneqwxOFOMw_WNDPnX0PdBfUVA/edit?usp=sharing\">after</a> workshops</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1fQNLvf1C8kj4rY-hVVY5zCsxy0z03gGkiqc-wiHHYhI/edit?usp=sharing\">Introductory slide deck for Day 1</a>, <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1w_0CGX2DNUDAIDT0MCaCPNqA_0HgamutaECP8kZ3yyI/edit?usp=sharing\">Introductory slide deck for Day 2</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gn5dk5RkuOXgZatd-Ow4XGqKY1NWZVCaUhyOwrRP0JE/edit?usp=sharing\">Agenda for workshop attendees</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1epeLO_7xkbd-WvPDCEZZ8f2GV5uMLHHM_UIhpZxqRbo/edit?usp=sharing\">Step-by-step guide for the workshop host</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>We hope these workshop materials help you share Gatsby at work, meetups, and wherever else it makes sense. Let us know how it goes and how you customize or modify these workshops!</p>\n<h2>How you can contribute</h2>\n<p>If you’d like to contribute to making workshops and tutorials more awesome, here are a few of the many issues we created in the <a href=\"https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/projects/3\">Documentation Project</a> as a result of what we learned in the workshops; contributions welcome! (Note: we used the main <a href=\"/gatsby-bloga-2/tutorial/\">tutorials</a> in the workshops, so edits and improvements to the tutorials also improve the workshop)</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Good first issue</em>: <a href=\"https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/issues/5608\">Emphasize file names</a> with (bold, italics, headers, or some other way) when people copy and paste code, because it’s easy to miss <em>where</em> you’re supposed to paste it with the current format</li>\n<li><em>Good first issue</em>: Make it clear in tutorial part 0 and workshops that all instructions are built assuming that you have installed <a href=\"https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/issues/5610\">VS Code and Prettier</a> because those work well with React</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/issues/5030\">Add a copy button to code examples</a> because people often missed backticks if their screen resolution didn’t make the ticks very visible</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We loved hosting workshops and plan to keep developing the resources as we learn. We’re so grateful for the workshop attendees and their feedback.</p>\n<p>And just as a reminder: we will keep improving these workshops and hope you’ll help us do that!
