Everyone who enters the contest will get a limited-edition Gatsby Theme Jam mug or t-shirt, and <strong>two winners will be selected to win a trip to the Gatsby Days event of their choosing</strong>.</p>\n<h2>What are Gatsby Themes?</h2>\n<p>Gatsby Themes are pre-built, installable packages for setting up a site’s default styling, components, plugins, and overall configuration that can be reused across multiple Gatsby sites. They’re a great way to simplify the early steps of configuring a new site; and, when it’s time to update your site’s styling or functionality, you only have to edit your theme or swap it out entirely with another compatible theme. You can find a more detailed explanation in the <a href=\"/gatsby-bloga-2/docs/themes/\">Themes section of Gatsby’s documentation</a>.</p>\n<p>If you’d like to see an example, check out Gatsby’s official <a href=\"https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/tree/master/packages/gatsby-theme-blog\">blog theme</a> or <a href=\"https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/tree/master/packages/gatsby-theme-notes\">notes theme</a>.</p>\n<h2>How to build your Gatsby theme</h2>\n<p>If you’re planning to build a theme for the contest, you may want to start with this <a href=\"https://github.com/jlengstorf/gatsby-theme-jam-example\">Gatsby Theme Jam Submission Example repository</a>.
