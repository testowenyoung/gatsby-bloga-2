After 5 months of\ndevelopment, Gatsby Manor is now in public alpha. Check out our\n<a href=\"https://landing.gatsbymanor.com/news/gatsbymanor-live\">themes</a> then use our <a href=\"https://landing.gatsbymanor.com/news/gatsbymanor-live\">getting started</a> guide to\nkickstart your Gatsby project.</p>\n<h2>Overview</h2>\n<p>Gatsby Manor is built on top of Gatsby to provide a painless way of building\nwebsites with reusable React components we call themes. We even have a\ncleverly named npm module for theme management called\n<a href=\"https://landing.gatsbymanor.com/news/gatsbymanor-live\">Jay</a> ðŸ˜„.</p>\n<p>With Jay you can download a theme from our collection, and mount it as a default\ntheme. Styles are applied instantly without server restarts or additional lines\nof code. Because of React, interactivity is supported out of the box.</p>\n<p>Want to switch themes? No problem. Jay can archive themes for later use in a\nthemes folder in your local directory. Edit and swap themes as often as you want\nand Jay will manage the process. Want to learn more?

I wanted a way to\nrebuild my website with ease however the approaches were less than exciting.</p>\n<p>Building a new site myself would require a lot of time. My imagination often\nruns wild when it comes to web design and what is supposed take a day of work\nturns into weeks of site iterations. The joys of web development often causes me\nto over-engineer simple websites. Not to mention that building a development\nenvironment alone is the biggest requirement when starting from scratch.\nTherefore another option needed to be explored.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/\">WordPress</a> would be the fastest solution to build a\nwebsite but I wanted to be able to rapidly prototype on customs themes.\nUnfortunately, understanding the architecture to develop themes on this stack\nwould require additional time. Not to mention I dislike PHP (#sorryNotSorry ðŸ˜…)\ntherefore this option was a clear loser. I tried <a href=\"https://gohugo.io/\">Hugo</a> and\n<a href=\"https://jekyllrb.com/\">Jekyll</a>. They gave me the right mix of speed and\ncontrol. But their templating languages were unappealing as long term options.</p>\n<p>When I stumbled onto Gatsby, I found the golden goose. I already worked with\nReact before, therefore I could prototype rapidly. The development environment\ngave me a tight feedback loop out of the box. And I had all the control in the\nworld for enhanced interactive features.</p>\n<h2>The development process</h2>\n<p>Once settled on Gatsby, I started working on my personal website. Within 2\nhours I wanted to prototype with different design elements because I found\ninspiration from <a href=\"https://html5up.net/\">html5up</a> templates. However I did not\nwant to discard my work so far.</p>\n<p>I decided to make a new directory to store my outdated work, like a true digital\nhoarder. A few more hours passed and I found myself yearning for\nmy original design choice because the new design was too complex. I knew this\nsituation would occur again (sometimes I can be indecisive ðŸ˜…) so I decided to build\na small cli tool to switch between themes easily. But first I needed a name, and\nJay seemed the most clever since I was working with Gatsby.</p>\n<p>As I was debugging code one day, I stumbled onto a feature request for a\n<a href=\"https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/issues/2662\">theme system</a>. At that moment,\nI decided I was going to build a theme solution for the community. Five\nmonths later, Gatsby Manor was born.</p>\n<h2>Final notes</h2>\n<p>Gatsby Manor is in public alpha stage.
