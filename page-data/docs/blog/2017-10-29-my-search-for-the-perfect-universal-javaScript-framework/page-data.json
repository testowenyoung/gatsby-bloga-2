Finally I could\nwrite structured code to create full web applications for our users. And with\nBackbone.js and Node.js, a new dream started to emerge, a website that starts\nrendering on the server side and continues to render on the users’ browsers.</p>\n<p>I spent days and nights trying to build a generic isomorphic web framework that\nstarts with server side rendering (SSR) and then continues work in the browser.\nIt was difficult to design and I could only make it meet the use case of my\ncompany—with lots of small hacks to get the job done. Airbnb made a shot at\nbuilding such a framework as well with\n<a href=\"https://github.com/rendrjs/rendr\">rendr</a>. It was the closest thing to a\nBackbone.js isomorphic web framework, but it didn’t support the full features of\nBackbone.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://reactjs.org\">React</a> was the game changer. It was better suited to\nbuilding universal apps since its core idea is mapping state to DOM, or in the\nserver rendering case, state to an HTML string. But still, making React render\non the server side and then rehydrating it on the client side includes solving\nmany edge cases, messy configuration, and cryptic knowledge of Babel and\nwebpack.</p>\n<p>So universal web apps are great but hard. And even when you do get universal\nReact working, SSR can be super slow and CPU intensive so it’ll often hog the\nNode.js event loop. Even after lots of optimizing, our team’s ultimate solution\nis always caching.</p>\n<p>But why dynamically rendered content just to cache it when you can just\npre-cache everything? AKA static websites?</p>\n<p>This is what Gatsby enables. It makes it trivial to build React websites as\npre-cached/built static websites.</p>\n<p>I love static websites. That’s how we all started building websites, right? For\nme it was an online editor of\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahoo!_GeoCities\">GeoCities</a> and that was all we\nneeded back then. Why not go back to static websites? They are fast, scalable,\nsecure and eliminate time consuming devops work.</p>\n<p>Static websites aren’t a great fit for everything. Full webapps behind login can\nbe fully rendered on the client side so see small benefit from static rendering\nsince each visit is personalized. Serving a statically rendered “shell” for the\nwebsite could help with perceived performance, but… let’s get back to talking\nabout static websites and leave discussing web apps for another time.</p>\n<p>Sprinkling JavaScript on a static website can be tricky, but Gatsby does this so\nwell with React that you don’t have to think about it at all—it just works. I\nused to tweak my configuration all the time to achieve better performance, but\nGatsby allows me to outsource the configuration and optimization and get a super\nfast website with zero work.</p>\n<p>I’ll also mention <a href=\"https://github.com/vercel/next.js/\">next.js</a> which is quite\nsimilar and supports both SSR for dynamic content and exporting to static pages.\nAnd don’t forget <a href=\"https://www.netlify.com\">Netlify</a> who is doing an amazing job\nat building and hosting static websites.</p>\n<p>It is so much easier and fun to code for the web today. I would have saved a\nlot of development/devops hours at my previous startup just by using Gatsby. And\nthe most fun fact about Gatsby is these aren’t modern ideas at all - it’s just\nstatic websites done right.</p>\n<p>This post is based on a\n<a href=\"https://twitter.com/ketacode/status/924243146795515904\">tweetstorm</a> - find me\non Twitter <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ketacode\">@ketacode</a></p>","frontmatter":{"title":"My search for the perfect universal JavaScript framework","date":"October 29, 2017","description":null}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/docs/blog/2017-10-29-my-search-for-the-perfect-universal-javaScript-framework/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/docs/blog/2017-10-20-from-wordpress-to-developing-in-react-starting-to-see-it/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"From WordPress to Developing in React — Starting to See It"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/docs/blog/2017-11-06-migrate-hugo-gatsby/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Migrate from Hugo to Gatsby"}}}}}
