In this series of eleven videos, you can catch up with all the wit and wisdom shared at the presentations from our February community gathering in LA. If you werenâ€™t able to make it in person, these videos are the next best thing to owning a time machine! (Though owning a time machine would be super cool for sure, joining us at our next Gatsby Daysâ€”currently scheduled as a virtual event June 2nd-3rdâ€”would be pretty awesome, too ðŸ’œ. Follow <a href=\"https://twitter.com/gatsbyjs\">Gatsby on Twitter</a> to keep up with when registration starts, speaker announcements and other developments).</em></p>\n<p>Zac Gordon is a community builder at <a href=\"https://www.strattic.com/\">Strattic</a> the serverless WordPress host Strattic and an educator who has taught courses on building with JavaScript and Gatsby in WordPress for high schools, colleges, bootcamps, and online learning sites.
