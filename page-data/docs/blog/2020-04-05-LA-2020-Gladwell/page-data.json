In this series of eleven videos, you can catch up with all the wit and wisdom shared at the presentations from our February community gathering in LA. If you werenâ€™t able to make it in person, these videos are the next best thing to owning a time machine! (Though owning a time machine would be super cool for sure, joining us at our next Gatsby Daysâ€”currently scheduled as a virtual event June 2nd-3rdâ€”would be pretty awesome, too ðŸ’œ. Follow <a href=\"https://twitter.com/gatsbyjs\">Gatsby on Twitter</a> to keep up with when registration starts, speaker announcements and other developments).</em></p>\n<p>Grant Glidewell is a React developer dedicated to employing modern technologies in cutting-edge projects. During his time at the digital experience agency Third and Grove, Grant was part of the team that integrated Drupal and Gatsby to create the agencyâ€™s fast, yet content-rich website. He also helped build Gatsby Preview + Drupalâ€”a live preview module for Drupal that can be used with Gatsby Cloud.</p>\n<p>At Gatsby Days LA 2020, Grant focused on performance. After analyzing top Gatsby-based sites, he and his team identified best practices that can help developers achieve blazing fast speeds. Check out this video of Grantâ€™s presentation to discover how Gatsby Builds helped Third and Grove reduce build times for its image-heavy site from about 40 minutes to only 8. And learn how Gatsbyâ€™s lazy load components can deliver impressive performance benefits without excessive coding.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMorT50I0cw\" title=\"Gatsby Days LA Video 3: What separates the fastest Gatsby sites from everybody else with Grant Glidewell\"><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/marcomontalbano/image/upload/v1585858632/video_to_markdown/images/youtube--xMorT50I0cw-c05b58ac6eb4c4700831b2b3070cd403.jpg\" alt=\"Gatsby Days LA Video 3: What separates the fastest Gatsby sites from everybody else with Grant Glidewell\"></a></p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Gatsby Days LA 2020 Video 3: Slash Build Times with Gatsby Builds Best Practices","date":"April 05, 2020","description":null}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/docs/blog/2020-04-05-LA-2020-Gladwell/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/docs/blog/100days/use-themes/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Challenge 14 - Rapidly Build Sites with Gatsby Themes"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/docs/blog/2020-04-06-commonwealth-aten-case-study/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Upping the Scorecard: Commonwealth Fund goes from dense to delightful with Gatsby"}}}}}
