But what’s this? You don’t have any phone signal, and the WiFi connection is spotty at best – if there is one at all! You attempt to open the page, but try as you might, the loading spinner just keeps on spinning…</p>\n<p>With <code class=\"language-text\">gatsby-plugin-offline</code>, that’s a thing of the past. Install the plugin in an existing Gatsby site using npm or Yarn, add it to your <code class=\"language-text\">gatsby-config.js</code>, and your site will instantly gain offline support without any additional configuration needed. (Read full instructions on how to <a href=\"/gatsby-bloga-2/docs/add-offline-support-with-a-service-worker/\">add offline support with a service worker\n</a>.) Now, whenever someone visits a page on your site, that page will be available later without an internet connection, along with any other pages which have been preloaded in the background.</p>\n<p>Recently <code class=\"language-text\">gatsby-plugin-offline</code> version 3 was released, adding some exciting new features such as the ability to pre-cache a customized set of pages. It also introduced some under-the-hood changes, the most notable being a major version upgrade of <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/web/tools/workbox\">Workbox</a>, the library which powers the core functionality of <code class=\"language-text\">gatsby-plugin-offline</code>. However, arguably the most interesting change is that the plugin will now keep working even if you disable JavaScript on a website which uses it.</p>\n<p>How does this work? Service workers and page-level JavaScript run in different contexts and don’t have direct access to each other’s context, although they can communicate with each other using a built-in message API - or even via data contained within a request, since requests can be intercepted by the service worker. More on that point later.</p>\n<p><code class=\"language-text\">gatsby-plugin-offline</code> has a wrapper API which makes use of the message API, enabling the page-level JavaScript to transfer data to/from the service worker - for example, this can be used to specify which JavaScript and CSS resources are essential for a particular page. Its service worker also serves a lightweight “offline shell” for pages which are available from the cache (determined by checking for each of the essential resources) instead of the full pre-rendered HTML.</p>\n<p>When you (or someone accessing your website) disable JavaScript for a particular domain, contrary to what you might expect, any service workers installed on that domain keep running. This means the plugin will continue to intercept page requests and serve a shallow offline shell if it determines that all the resources are available - even though JavaScript is required to display the content of the page in this case (since the offline shell doesn’t contain pre-rendered HTML).</p>\n<p>With <code class=\"language-text\">gatsby-plugin-offline</code> version 3, this is no longer the case. When the plugin detects that JavaScript is disabled, it automatically disables the offline shell and switches to full pre-rendered HTML, allowing the site to function again! This is a huge advantage for accessibility, since it allows people to toggle scripts even after they’ve initially visited a site, without causing it to stop working.</p>\n<p>So, how does the service worker detect that JS is disabled, given that the client can’t use JS to communicate this to the worker? Back to an earlier point: we can also communicate to the service worker using data contained within a request, such as its URL. So, if we request a specially formatted URL, and “catch” this request from within the service worker, we can tell it that JS is disabled.</p>\n<p>How does this work in practice? Firstly, the service worker keeps track of which page was requested last. Within the offline shell, we include a <code class=\"language-text\">noscript</code> tag in the head, inside which is a <code class=\"language-text\">meta</code> tag that specifies an immediate redirect to the URL <code class=\"language-text\">/.gatsby-plugin-offline:api=disableOfflineShell&amp;redirect=true</code>. The service worker then “catches” this request, disables the offline shell, and then sends a <code class=\"language-text\">Location</code> header in its response which sends the browser back to the initially requested page.</p>\n<p>If you want to try out this feature for yourself, <a href=\"/gatsby-bloga-2/docs/add-offline-support-with-a-service-worker/\">add the latest <code class=\"language-text\">gatsby-plugin-offline</code> to an existing site</a>, or use the <a href=\"/gatsby-bloga-2/docs/gatsby-cli\">Gatsby CLI</a> to run <code class=\"language-text\">gatsby new my-blog gatsby-starter-blog</code> and create a new site which includes the plugin out-of-the-box.
