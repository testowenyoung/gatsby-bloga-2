And 500 of them are source plugins (<a href=\"https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/pull/23558\">thanks for noticing Chris Ellis</a>). So for whatever your use case, for whatever your data source, there’s a Gatsby plugin that can get you up-and-running quickly. And if you need inspiration for your project, GitHub lists <a href=\"https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/network/dependents?package_id=UGFja2FnZS0xNDM0MDY2Nw%3D%3D\">over 200 thousand sites that use Gatsby</a> as a dependency!</p>\n<p>In May we also announced our <a href=\"/gatsby-bloga-2/blog/2020-05-27-announcing-series-b-funding/\">series B round of funding round</a>. This investment will help us double down on changing the way the web is built. We’ve already made Gatsby work better for large and media rich sites. You can keep tabs on Gatsby’s progress at <a href=\"https://willit.build\">Will It Build</a>, a new benchmarking site that showcases sub-10-second builds for projects of different sizes and data sources.</p>\n<h2>🚀 New in Gatsby &#x26; Gatsby Cloud</h2>\n<h3>Strapi Instant Preview</h3>\n<p>Your content editors can now enjoy “instant preview” with Strapi and Gatsby Cloud!

We’re like a CI/CD tooth fairy.</p>\n<p>For example, Agility CMS is <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AgilityCMS/status/1257711270532452354\">seeing 5 second builds</a> for their own 500-page website! How can this be? Some say it’s <a href=\"https://twitter.com/3cordguy/status/1257079916434251780\">unicorn magic</a>.</p>\n<p>Again, you can take a peek at our build time benchmarks at <a href=\"https://willit.build\">Will It Build</a>.</p>\n<h3>Faster, and Faster Websites</h3>\n<p>Fast builds are a great experience for your website’s editor, but what about your end-users? The only speed they care about is loading times.</p>\n<p>Thanks to a <a href=\"https://web.dev/granular-chunking-nextjs/\">collaboration with the Chrome team</a>, we’ve made Gatsby sites more performant - again, without you having to make any changes.</p>\n<p>How? By bundling a dependency that is used in at least 2 pages, Gatsby can chunk them together so you don’t have to download duplicate libraries over and over again.</p>\n<p>This won’t benefit first-page load, but it improves page navigation as your site needs less JavaScript for the next route. Gatsby projects like Ghost’s website saw a 35% reduction in the overall JavaScript they shipped to browsers.</p>\n<h3>Faster, and Faster Configuration</h3>\n<p>When we launched the alpha of Gatsby Recipes in April, it caused a stir in the Web Development community. Immediately many of you understood the potential of Recipes and our vision to make configuring a website as fast and painless as possible.</p>\n<p>If you missed the initial launch, Paul Scanlon can bring you up-to-speed with <a href=\"/gatsby-bloga-2/blog/2020-05-21-gatsby-recipes/\">“Gatsby Recipes - What’s All the Fuss About?”</a>. Also, since the launch there’s been an avalanche of official and community made Recipes, including scripts for configuring:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>React libraries like <a href=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/master/packages/gatsby-recipes/recipes/gatsby-plugin-react-helmet.mdx\">React Helmet</a> and <a href=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/master/packages/gatsby-recipes/recipes/preact.mdx\">Preact</a></li>\n<li>Themes and Starters, like <a href=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/master/packages/gatsby-recipes/recipes/gatsby-theme-blog.mdx\">gatsby-theme-blog</a> and <a href=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/master/packages/gatsby-recipes/recipes/gatsby-theme-notes.mdx\">gatsby-theme-notes-starter</a></li>\n<li>Advanced configs, like <a href=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/master/packages/gatsby-recipes/recipes/wordpress.mdx\">headless WordPress</a> and <a href=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/master/packages/gatsby-recipes/recipes/pwa.mdx\">Progressive WebApps</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Learn how to develop your own Gatsby Recipes from the <a href=\"https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/tree/master/packages/gatsby-recipes\">Gatsby Recipes README</a>. And if you’re looking for ideas, I could really use a Recipe that spins up placeholder sites for all of the unused domains I purchased last year. And for all of the domains I’m going to purchase - and not use - this year.</p>\n<h3>TypeScript Support</h3>\n<p>Gatsby loves the TypeScript community. When you pass one of them, you know exactly what type of person you’re dealing with.</p>\n<p>This month we made the Gatsby TypeScript plugin part of core Gatsby, so you no longer need to install it to enable TypeScript support in your project. Read our <a href=\"/gatsby-bloga-2/docs/typescript/\">updated TypeScript docs</a> and the Pull Request that enacted this change (<a href=\"https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/pull/23547\">https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/pull/23547</a>). Also <a href=\"https://twitter.com/gatsbyjs/status/1258427651066400768\">join the Twitter conversation</a>.</p>\n<h3>GraphQL Tracing</h3>\n<p>In may we continued to improve our error messaging (see example <a href=\"https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/pull/24186\">here</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/pull/23741\">here</a>). But what about slow GraphQL queries? Well, Gatsby now supports performance tracing using the OpenTracing standard. You can to <a href=\"/gatsby-bloga-2/docs/performance-tracing/\">enable tracing for GraphQL queries</a>. This is useful because it allows you to debug why querying may be slow in your Gatsby project.</p>\n<h2>👩‍🚀 New in the Gatsby Community</h2>\n<h3>Gatsby Days is June 2 - 3</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.gatsbyjs.com/resources/gatsby-days/\">Register to attend</a> our first ever Virtual Gatsby Days!</p>\n<p>We have a superb <a href=\"/gatsby-bloga-2/blog/2020-05-13-virtual-gatsby-day-speakers/\">lineup of speakers</a> from the Gatsby community.
