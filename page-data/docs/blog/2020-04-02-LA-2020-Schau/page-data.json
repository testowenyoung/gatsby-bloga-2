In this series of eleven videos, you can catch up with all the wit and wisdom shared at the presentations from our February community gathering in LA. If you werenâ€™t able to make it in person, these videos are the next best thing to owning a time machine! (Though owning a time machine would be super cool for sure, joining us at our next Gatsby Daysâ€”currently scheduled as a virtual event June 2nd-3rdâ€”would be pretty awesome, too ðŸ’œ. Follow <a href=\"https://twitter.com/gatsbyjs\">Gatsby on Twitter</a> to keep up with when registration starts, speaker announcements and other developments).</em></p>\n<p>Dustin Schau, Gatsbyâ€™s Head of Product, is a dedicated open source developer. He was first drawn to the framework by Gatsbyâ€™s exceptional performance and outstanding developer experience. Now a Gatsby team member, Dustin is focused on making Gatsby the fastest, most inclusive platform for building websites and web applications.</p>\n<p>Watch Dustin demonstrate the impressive build-time performance of Gatsby and Gatsby Cloud by walking through typical developer workflows, including updating a website using Contentfulâ€™s headless CMS and then rapidly deploying the results through a content delivery network (CDN). And discover how Gatsby enables developers to quickly incorporate accessibility capabilitiesâ€”such as a SkipNav functionâ€”to deliver inclusive web experiences to the widest possible audience.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbR47FqMJYY\" title=\"Gatsby Days LA Video 2: What&#x27;s next for Gatsby and Gatsby Cloud\"><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/marcomontalbano/image/upload/v1585776287/video_to_markdown/images/youtube--zbR47FqMJYY-c05b58ac6eb4c4700831b2b3070cd403.jpg\" alt=\"Gatsby Days LA Video 2: What&#x27;s next for Gatsby and Gatsby Cloud\"></a></p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Gatsby Days LA 2020 Video 2: Live demo of Gatsby + Contentful developer workflow","date":"April 02, 2020","description":null}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/docs/blog/2020-04-02-LA-2020-Schau/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/docs/blog/2020-04-02-community-qa-with-kyle-mathews/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"March 6th Community Q&A with Kyle Mathews"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/docs/blog/100days/use-themes/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Challenge 14 - Rapidly Build Sites with Gatsby Themes"}}}}}
