I read on to see how easy it’d be to\nupgrade.</p>\n<p>Having never used GraphQL, the new “routeQuery” in components looked very\nforeign.</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"javascript\"><pre class=\"language-javascript\"><code class=\"language-javascript\"><span class=\"token keyword\">export</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">const</span> routeQuery <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> `\n<span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n  allMarkdown <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n    edges <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n      node <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n        path\n        frontmatter <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n          title\n        <span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span>\n      <span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span>\n    <span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span>\n  <span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span>\n<span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span></code></pre></div>\n<p>What happened to my “drop files into a folder and call it a day” setup? What\n<em>is</em> all this weird syntax <a href=\"https://twitter.com/kylemathews\">@kylemathews</a>?</p>\n<p>Reading the issue, Kyle’s reasoning made sense but this didn’t seem to be simple\nat all. 0.x seemed more “automatic” to me. Drop in your files and go.</p>\n<h2>1.0 Released</h2>\n<p>When 1.0 landed, I waited for a while before trying to update my website. The\nreviews were solid but I was still stuck on my pre-1.0 mindset.</p>\n<p>Then three weeks ago I saw this tweet from\n<a href=\"https://twitter.com/ryanflorence\">@ryanflorence</a>:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/ryanflorence/status/906233888560758784\">https://twitter.com/ryanflorence/status/906233888560758784</a></p>\n<p>Well, that sounded like a pretty good endorsement.</p>\n<h2>Taking the leap</h2>\n<p>With the <a href=\"https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-blog\">gatsby-starter-blog</a>\nin hand as a solid example, I started converting my website over to v1.0.</p>\n<p>There were a few bumps into the road but thanks to the starter example, I pieced\nthings together quickly. Quickly as in “I have no idea how this GraphQL stuff\nworks, but I have it working, so cool”. Easy to update — check.</p>\n<h2>Digging deeper</h2>\n<p>I’m not the type of person to settle on “It’s working so don’t touch anything”.\nSo I started digging into how Gatsby 1.x works—particular the\n<a href=\"/gatsby-bloga-2/tutorial/part-four/#data-in-gatsby\">data layer</a>.</p>\n<p>Things really clicked when I read this part about the GraphiQL IDE and watched\nhow to drill down on the data.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/gatsby-bloga-2/54896a75a1448107a7ba69f27ae246da/graphiql.gif\" alt=\"GraphiQL\"></p>\n<p>Prior to reading / seeing that part in the documentation, looking at the code I\ncould understand roughly what was going on but it didn’t feel familiar. Like\nanything new, there’s that “I don’t know what I’m doing” stage. I know what I\nwant to do, but I don’t understand the syntax enough to make it happen. Seeing\nthe docs and how you can explore the schema in GraphiQL (autocomplete is 👌) to\nsee what data is available really helped in my “play around and break stuff”\nphase.</p>\n<p><strong>From the docs:</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>You first sketch out the data query by playing in GraphiQL, then copy this to\na React page component to start building the UI.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>“Sketch &#x26; Copy” using the GraphiQL was a revelation. I was thinking it’s going\nto be tricky to manually write the queries until I become more familiar with the\nsyntax. Using GraphiQL helped me make a quick leap forward with the learning\ncurve. “Aha this is amazing”. I have lots to learn still but the comfort level\nis going up.</p>\n<h2>That’s a wrap</h2>\n<p>With my 1.x update complete, I’m feeling that not only was GatsbyJS a solid\npick, but it’s something that is going to evolve the way I build websites. It’s\na nice starter push into GraphQL and many other advanced features the websites\nof the future will need to be performant.</p>\n<p>Sometimes we don’t do things because they are unfamiliar to us. Sometimes we\nneed a little push. Thanks for the push GatsbyJS. The learning curve may seem\ndaunting but the payoff is huge. GatsbyJS has become a powerful tool in my\narsenal and I’m happy to have extended my development skills.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Embracing GraphQL — How I migrated React FAQ to Gatsby v1","date":"September 26, 2017","description":null}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/docs/blog/2017-09-26-embracing-graphql/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/docs/blog/2017-09-21-community-roundup-1/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Community Roundup #1"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/docs/blog/2017-10-01-migrating-my-blog-from-hexo-to-gatsby/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Migrating My Blog From Hexo To Gatsby"}}}}}
