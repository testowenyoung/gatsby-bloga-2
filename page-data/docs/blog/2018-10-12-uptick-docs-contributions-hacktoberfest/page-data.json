In the first 5 days of October we <a href=\"https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/pulls?utf8=%E2%9C%93&#x26;q=is%3Apr+sort%3Aupdated-desc+is%3Aclosed+label%3A%22type%3A+documentation%22+language%3Aswift+closed%3A%3E2018-10-01\">merged 31 PR’s with the <code class=\"language-text\">documentation</code> label</a> (and by the time you click on that link, it will likely be more than 31, especially if PR’s are labeled correctly!).</p>\n<p>A big thanks to every contributor who jumped in to help Gatsby docs keep becoming more polished, comprehensive, and clear. In fact, many of the PR’s fixed problems we hadn’t even created issues for yet! And we’re increasing the number of <code class=\"language-text\">hacktoberfest</code> + <code class=\"language-text\">documentation</code> labeled issues to account for the surge of helpful contributions. A special thanks to <a href=\"https://github.com/amberleyromo\">@amberleyromo</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/jlengstorf\">@jlengstorf</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/DSchau\">@DSchau</a>, and <a href=\"https://github.com/pieh\">@pieh</a> for their hard work giving feedback and merging PR’s!</p>\n<p>Read more on how to participate in Gatsby Hacktoberfest in our <a href=\"/gatsby-bloga-2/blog/2018-10-09-hacktoberfest-kickoff/\">Hacktoberfest kickoff post</a></p>\n<h2>With great contributions comes great responsibility</h2>\n<p>The increase in contributions means the Gatsby community makes more frequent decisions about what goes in the docs and what doesn’t, how to title them, the best slugs for SEO, and when to create new categories.</p>\n<p>This has led to two changes:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/jlengstorf\">@jlengstorf</a> created the <a href=\"https://github.com/orgs/gatsbyjs/teams/docs\">@gatsbyjs/docs team</a> in GitHub that automatically notifies whomever is on the team whenever a PR includes edits to anything within /docs/.</li>\n<li>With the help of many people, I created a “docs decision tree,” so that when the <a href=\"https://github.com/orgs/gatsbyjs/teams/docs\">@gatsbyjs/docs team</a> is notified, they can make decisions in a unified manner according to a set of agreed-upon principles (which can be adjusted over time). This will help anyone making decisions pertaining to docs escape any biases and fickleness. The “docs decision tree” will be tested over Hacktoberfest with all issues labeled <code class=\"language-text\">documentation</code> and collect discussion in the <a href=\"https://github.com/gatsbyjs/rfcs/pull/14\">Docs Decision Tree RFC</a>.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>Docs Decision Tree and Examples</h2>\n<p>Here is a summary of the “docs decision tree,” a tool we’ll use to make decisions about how to grow and maintain Gatsby docs.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>You can also look at a visualization of the decision tree(s) in <a href=\"https://whimsical.co/78PmoqFTbJJxpXHA1a6gba\">Whimsical</a>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>Doc qualification criteria</h2>\n<p>A doc qualifies to be in the .org site if it:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Deals with a piece of Gatsby-maintained software (e.g. pertains to code in the <a href=\"https://www.github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby\">Gatsby OSS repository</a>), a core dependency of the code in the Gatsby OSS repo, or a third-party software that works well with Gatsby and is in high demand</li>\n</ol>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Yes</strong> —> Belongs in the docs (to make sure we don’t have to maintain docs about core dependencies and third-party software, we will focus on linking to their docs as much as possible)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>No</strong> —> Belongs in blog, marketing, Twitter, podcast, starter library, plugin library, etc.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li>\n<p>Helps further something on the <a href=\"https://pronovix.com/blog/analyzing-api-docs-and-dx-patterns-best-banking-developer-portals\">developer journey</a>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Discover</li>\n<li>Evaluate</li>\n<li>Get Started</li>\n<li>Implement &#x26; Troubleshoot</li>\n<li>Celebrate &#x26; Share</li>\n<li>Contribute &#x26; Maintain</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Yes</strong> —> Belongs in the docs</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>No</strong> —> Does not belong in the docs</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>Handling proposed doc changes</h2>\n<h3>Someone wants to create a new doc</h3>\n<p>Does doc already exist?</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Yes</strong> —> Is there a discovery problem?
